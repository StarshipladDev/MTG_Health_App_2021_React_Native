26/12/2021{

	"Title":"Inital Upload",
	"Summary":"Create the Main Class Componenet, Add Inital Image Files, Update Icons",
	"HealthCounter":{
		"Backend Logic":["Update refrences of minion index to be the index rather than index-1. This is due to no longer needing a workaround where (index) would be false if index was 0 due to javascript stuff"],
		"Frontend Display":[
		"Add color objects to state as strings. Modify componenet's color style to refrence this instead of being hard-coded. This is to allow modular coloring",
		"Move Minion Componenets below health componenets to allow for cleaner UX "]
	},
	"images":{
		"ImageFiles":["Add 50x50 image .pngs to be displayed via 'HealthCounter.js's 'Image' componenets, to allow nice UI with images"]
	}
	
}
